				<p>My name is Robert Down and I am running for SNA President. I am a 27-year old, second-semester nursing student with a passion for helping others and a drive for excellence in all that I do. Allow me to tell you a bit about myself, and why I am running for president.</p>
				<p>Nursing school has impacted my life in countless ways. I look back at the person I was just a few months ago during Intro and wonder how I could have grown so much, so fast. I have seen my passion for emerging and developing populations become an integral part of who I am.</p>
				<p>With a background in IT and a heart for those in need I have contributed software to OpenEMR, a royalty-free EMR solution deployed to over 115,000 practioners throughout the world. In January of this year I was elected to the Board of Directors for OEMR, the non-profit behind OpenEMR.</p>
				<p>I believe every life is sacred. This basic assumption guides my beliefs regarding war, famine, poverty, foreign and domestic aid, as well as aid within my own local community. I struggle to understand the relentless wars waged around the world, or the fact that a wide majority of the world lives in poverty. And while I know it is unrealistic to think I can end poverty, homelessness, or human trafficking by myself, I am convicted to help those most at-risk.</p>
				<p>Access to health care is a fundamental human right, and one aspect that defines the essence of humanity is the fact that we don't simply leave the sick or wounded behind to die; we come together as a collective to ensure those in need are granted a fighting chance. Embracing the role of an advocate, I have learned to use my voice to speak for those who may otherwise remain voiceless. I have also developed a considerable passion for informatics and developing license-free electronic medical records software for providers in developing countries. Focusing on the intersection of my information technology skills, role as a nurse-advocate, and empathy for emerging populations has helped me to become a more influential healthcare professional.</p>

						<h2>Handling the pressure</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Nursing school is stressful. Managing a board of directors is stressful. I have experienced personal hardships and stress where life and death hung in the balance: I am prepared to deal with the stresses of being President. Everything I have experienced in life thusfar has helped me to keep a clear head and perspective about SNA.</p>

					<h2>1: Develop strategic community partnerships</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="8u -2u">
					<p>I am passionate about helping people, it is a core value of almost every nurse. Specifically I am passionate about helping <em>underserved</em> populations. In the Orlando area this means the homeless, victims of human trafficking, and the hungry. As President, I want to work closely with ADU's Community Outreach Director to establish partnerships with the community. Students DO have services to offer! We have the ability to impact positive change right this very moment and I will work tirelessly to make this a reality for SNA.</p>

						<h2>2: Increased funding</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="8u -2u">
						<p>The overarching goal of our SNA chapter is to prepare ourselves to be the best nurses we can be. There are many ways to achieve this: many of them require financial stabliity. As president I will make it a top priority to increase our operating budget to further prepare us as student nurses. Having been the recipient of scholarships from SNA to travel to Tallahassee for Advocacy Days, and Daytona Beach to represent ADU during the 2015 FNSA Annual Convention I can speak from personal experience to the importance of ensuring financial aid to students who proactively seek out opportunities to grow.

						<h2>3: Expanded number of scholarships</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="8u -2u">
					<p>Scholarships are foundational to improve outreach amongst members. I get particularly nervous about finances, tuition, financial aid, etc--somehow I have a feeling I am not alone. When an opportunity presents itself one of my first questions is, "What are the costs associated with it" followed almost immediately by, "Is assistence available through scholarships?" As a chapter, we must create as many opportities as possible to put the students that demonstrate a desire to grow as a student nurse in the positions to allow growth to occur.</p>

						<h2>4: Formalize the ADU SNA policies and procedures</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="8u -2u">
					<p>ADU SNA is still young, and while we have become a strong chapter within the state we have a lot of work to do. Given the presence our students have at the state level through FNSA we must formalize the inner plumbing of SNA: This means drafting policies and procedures that lay out how we as a chapter operate. Growing pains exist with any association and ours is no different. We need a leader willing to tackle the issues that may stifle our growth.</p>
